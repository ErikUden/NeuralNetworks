# NeuralNetworks
The neural networks I have been programming with TensorFlow over the years.

Singular projects that have evolved into their own big program will be uploaded into new repositories but linked here! 

Since TensorFlow updated itself to 2.0.0-rc1 and if you look to all the available downloads also 2.0.0-rc2, just without GPU-Support which is something I need, most of my programs can run way more efficient which is why I'm currently in the process of skimming through the deep sea of SublimeTexts to see which are still compatible and which need some tinkering. The fact that there's little to nothing in this repository tells you that there is a lot of tinkering which needs to be done! 

TensorFlow 2.0.0 now also is available for Google Colab, which means TPU support! 
My Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab is here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k4NJ-WV4FvpaW1Lxny-MTTDYy4p3GkYq
I'm testing the newest correct AIs on there, so stay tuned!
Google has maximum output limits, very bad for my kind of work, will continue doing complex AIs on my laptop and upload once finished, poorly no work in progress will be visible by that then!


For MiniConda, Anaconda or Conda users in general, remember to use Ana-/Mini-/Conda Prompt instead of regular Command Prompt! Except if you use Git Bash, then just continue using that. 
Should work on every operating system with TensorFlow(Keras), numpy and DockerToolbox installed, also remember to activate virtualization!
